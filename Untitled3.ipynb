With the problems with the cat foods from China recently,I was concerned about the wheat gluten and other foul additives which are not good for the kittens.<br /><br />This company has a really good website where they state that none of those foul additives are in their foods and because of the classy looking website I was relieved enough to get this for my brood.<br /><br />On opening the can,I was surprised and pleased at the look of the food.<br />Bits of carrot and beautiful chunks of white meat chicken in a rich looking gravy. They say it\\'s \"People food for cats\" and it truly looks THAT good. But enough of my palaver, the important judges spoke up in the way that counts most,they concentrated on the new food until the plate was empty followed by contented grooming. The little girl cat is primarily one that picks at her food a few minutes then leaves and comes back later for more eating and on & on,but with this stuff she was parked in front of the dish till everything was consumed. I take that as a good sign',\n",

Cans make me nervous, I shy away from them whenever I can for health reasons. Also, there are no preservatives, the tomatoes are low in sodium and BPA free. The tomatoes are naturally grown in Italy without pesticides.<br /><br />I made a lasagna with both the strained tomatoes and the chopped tomatoes and it was the best lasagna I have ever had! The sauce was absolutely delicious, rich and fabulous. It was my first time making a lasagna sauce from scratch and I was worried it was going to be boring but it was zesty and stunning.<br /><br />Just last night I made my chili recipe with the chopped tomatoes. Sometimes canned tomatoes can be quite tough and hard to break down but these broke down perfectly. My only complaint is that the chili was a little dryer than usual but it was richer with an even deeper flavour thanks to these tomatoes.<br /><br />I would have bought these solely based on the fact that I could get tomatoes not in cans but after tasting the results of these fantastic tomatoes in my lasagna and chili... I will buy more.',\n",

One didn't like them at all, but the others gave them either 4 or 5 stars--particularly enjoying the smallness, crispness and lack of sweetness.  I probably wouldn't get them again for myself, but defnitely could put a bowl out for guests, as a casual alternative to greasier and sweeter snack foods.\",\n",

The flavor isn't just some mask for an inferior tea!<br /><br />The color of this tea is a bit brownish.  Those who are used to the vibrant green of matcha may be a bit shocked at first, but the brownish tint is undoubtedly from the flavoring.  The awesome awesome flavoring.

I emailed them after the 2nd month with my complaint,thinking they might want to take a second look at what was being sent. I did receive an immediate response, with an apology and an offer of an extra month of ice cream. They also told me they spoke with their shipper and was told my 3rd month was really going to be scrumptous. I just received it. May be somewhat better, but there is only one pint with higher butterfat then the average grocery store brand, 2 frozen custards, and 1 \"neopolitan\"(how exciting)in a square cardboard carton and from a company not even mentioned in their ad. We have a number of Ice Cream stores in our city and thus far I have only received 1 pint each month that might compare.

Hey, I'm getting happy with Gin, why do I care about calories. Oh no this is full flavored and just right. No artificial sweetener flavor.<br /><br />The sweetener is apparently fruit sugar - fructose. Now that's significantly different from high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). In theory, people who are sensitive to HFCS will not have a problem with this drink. The sensitivity is from the byproducts of making HFCS from corn. Since corn isn't involved and the process is different, this is simply pure fructose, something that is good for you.<br /><br />The perfect Gin and Tonic - fresh ice in a tall glass, one ounce of your favorite Gin (I happen to love Plymouth Gin right now), a small wedge of lime squeezed over the ice, pour in one bottle of Fever Tree tonic water. Enjoy. Whatever Gin you use, the Gin flavor will come out fresh and clean.<br /><br />There is a big downside to this stuff; your Gin budget will have to get larger.

It makes a good tasting alternative to regular or brown sugar in recipes that call for dates, or are date flavored.  Just remember that date sugar is a little sweeter than regular or brown sugar and should be used more sparingly.  Also, date sugar does not melt down and liquify like other sugar either.  When used in recipes it may appear as small brown flakes that give a more concentrated sweetness to cookies, bread, etc.  Date sugar is not cheap, but worth it for the few times you will use it for the special sweetness and flavor it adds. Also, it is near impossible to find in anything but gourmet shops so Amazon is a good bet if you are feeling favorable to it.  The only thing I would suggest is that you either order two or more pouches of this or something else that qualifies you for the free shipping.

       " 'Ok, so my cats aren\\'t really \"petite\", well except for the one, but I think they still enjoyed these snacks.  In fact, 4 out of 5 cats in my household enjoyed these treats.  There are some really great things about this brand, and some not so great things though.<br /><br />We\\'ll start with the good.  This tuna smelled so fantastic that I was half tempted to take a nibble myself.  You could tell they used quality fish and judging by their packaging, they were smart in their harvesting of the fish too.  Its got the dolphin safe logo and the eco-safe sustainable fishing stamp as well.  They go on to say that they take a break four months out of the year so that the fishing population remains intact.  I\\'d say that\\'s a pretty good way of doing things.  Its also advertised as a natural product.  So that\\'s pretty cool in a earth safe kind of way.  The only ingredients are tuna (wild caught) and water so that\\'s impressive as well with all the additives even being added to pet food anymore.<br /><br />Since I gave all the cats in the household (and that is again 5 between my mother and I) I was able to see the reaction of many different types of \"personalities\" to this food.  The one that doesn\\'t think she\\'s allowed to eat in front of us, went straight for it and started nibbling, but then snubbed her nose.  The old senile cat immediately ate it and then started eating the blanket she was laying on thinking there was more.  The bully cat ate one piece and then looked broken hearted when the smallest cat (who bullies the \"bully\" cat) hoarded the rest of the food.  That just left the one other cat who gobbled it up while meowing her pleasure and then started looking for more.  Overall it was pretty successful.<br /><br />Now on to the not so good things.  My first complaint with this product would be the packaging.  Upon opening I immediately got squirted with tuna water and had to go change my shirt as I didn\\'t want the cats trying to eat me (and you know the old senile one would try).  The plastic was tough to rip at the seals and that could have accounted for some of the problems, but it also didn\\'t have much of a lip for pulling apart either.  Next problem was the size of these things.  It came in three large slabs and I used one slab and broke it apart for all five cats to share as a treat.  And they still got plenty that way.  I\\'m not sure what they\\'re thinking when they call this food a \"treat.\"  And since there\\'s only three slabs, I\\'m going to get honest here and say that for the price, you could buy quite a few cans of tuna packed in water and have essentially the same thing as what came in this package.  Even if you bought them at whole foods you could probably get three cans for the same price.  So I\\'m not sure if this is quite a deal even if it is a eco-friendly product.<br /><br />The cats liked it though and if I were feeling in a generous mood I might get it for them again. It just wouldn\\'t be a regularly scheduled treat.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011',\n",

It is also lots of fun to give to anyone who hasn't had it before.<br /><br />If you don't know what freeze dried ice cream is, it is pretty straight forward. All of the water is removed from normal ice cream in a special way. First the ice cream is kept frozen while a vacuum is applied to it. The vacuum causes water to slowly sublimate and vaporize. The vaporized water is eventually all sucked out and you are left with a chunk of ice cream that has everything in it but water. Note, it doesn't melt. The process brings water straight from the solid to gas. This technique is used for lots of foods because it makes the food last forever -- without water most bacteria and molds simply can't grow.

       " 'As my baby approaches the stage at which we can introduce solids to her diet, I started doing my research on organic, prepared baby foods.  I was all set to make Earth\\'s Best my brand of choice, since we already use some of their other products (e.g., baby wipes).  But that was until I discovered that the covers of their glass jars contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor that can cause negative health effects, especially in vulnerable infants and young children.  Apparently, Earth\\'s Best claims that its jarred baby food has been independently-tested, and found to have undetectable levels of BPA.  However, I\\'m still skeptical.  In a \"perfect lab\" setting with a pristine jar of baby food, the BPA may not have had the opportunity to leach from the cover into the baby food.  But in the real world, by the time that jar of baby food reaches the average consumer, it has been turned upside-down and shaken up in the process of packing, shipping, unpacking, shelving, etc.  Plus, many parents warm up their baby food in the jars; and I\\'ve heard that heating can increase/speed-up the BPA leaching process.  SCARY STUFF!!  I don\\'t see why Earth\\'s Best doesn\\'t just play it safe and line their baby food jar covers with a resin that doesn\\'t contain BPA.  It\\'s honestly not that hard to do ... Just ask Eden Organics!  The linings of many of their canned vegetables are BPA-free.  Sure, it might increase the cost of the baby food by a bit, but I\\'m sure I speak for many parents when I say that I\\'d be willing to pay a little extra just for the peace of mind of knowing that there are no harmful chemicals in my baby\\'s food.  After all, we\\'re willing to spend a bit more for organic baby food to begin with.<br /><br />Earth\\'s Best also makes baby food in BPA-free pouches.

       " '*****<br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don\\'t grow your own (and I don\\'t anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it\\'s not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea\\'s benefits: \"Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities.\"<br /><br />Yogi Tea\\'s use of \"Kombucha-Pure\", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****',\n",
       " \"These k-cups are cheap because they don't have the plastic cup base. That means that they don't keep as long, but frankly I haven't had an issue with that. They are delivered in 12-pack bags with most of the air pushed out of a valve. I immediately put them in the freezer except for the current 12 I'm using. I drink about 3 cups a day, and keep the open k-cups in a sealed plastic bag on a shelf. Quality has not degraded to a point where I've even noticed.<br /><br />A few notes:<br />- This is apparently the same bean mix they use in Fog Chaser, but it clearly is a lighter roast. I find it suits my taste preferences better than Fog Chaser, and my understanding is that a lighter roast means more caffeine.<br />- A normal k-cup has a plastic base, the filter basket with the grounds, a plastic ring to hold the basket in place, and a metal foil seal. These are significantly cheaper in part because they don't have that cup. This leads to my storing the 12-packs in the freezer until I need them. I would suggest trying the ones with the full cup first to figure out if this (or Fog Chaser) can be your regular coffee, and if so, definitely get these.<br />- One issue that I don't care about, but others do, is that the cup isn't there to catch the really fine grounds. You will end up with some grounds at the bottom of your cup. If that bugs you, don't get these. The grounds are very fine and don't affect the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />Oh, the taste: it's a medium roast perhaps on the lighter side of the spectrum. If you like a darker roast (e.g., that popular coffee chain that burns their beans to ashes, IMHO),  then you'll like Fog Chaser more probably. The acidity and bitterness are well-balanced. I drink my coffee straight black, which is how I like it; if I kept the same taste but switched to cream and/or sugar, I would go with Fog Chaser. The thing I like about this blend/roast is that it has excellent flavor with a hint of nuttiness. It doesn't have a ton of body, IMHO, but that's just what I've found to be the case with the Keurig. I'm thinking about the K2, but I'll wait for more pod choices.<br /><br />Finally, I'll be honest, I don't buy these for eco reasons; I'm too picky about my coffee. However, there is less waste and, if I was the sort of person to compost, it would be very easy to separate the basket from the ring and compost the grounds.\",\n",

       " 'Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds \"single serve pods\" it does not specify that they\\'re pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here\\'s the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don\\'t really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don\\'t own a pod coffee maker.  I don\\'t like them very much.  I\\'m going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said \"teabagging\" with these things doesn\\'t work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn\\'t strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it\\'s 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: \"This side down\"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it\\'s a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it\\'s kind of pricey.  I don\\'t honestly think that I\\'d change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

Since my wife and I are not made of money we only go to places like these on special occasions or during a night out with friends.  Most of the time we choose to cook at home on our Weber grill.  If the menu calls for chicken or pork we always brush the meat with our favorite store bought sauce \"Sweet Baby Ray\\'s Honey Barbecue Sauce\".  Frankly, we find that the meat turns out every bit as tender and flavorful at it does at a restaurant for about 1/4 to 1/3 the price.<br /><br />Since I am not particularly fond of hickory smoke flavor we never barbequed at home very much.  Years ago hickory smoke barbecue sauce was just about the only variety available at your local supermarket.  As I recall that all began to change with the introduction of the KC Masterpiece line of sauces in the mid 1980\\'s.  Suddenly, exciting new flavors were bursting onto the scene.  I first became familiar with honey-flavored Bar-B-Que at a popular rib house in Montreal called Bar-B-Barn.  I just fell in love with the taste so when  \"Sweet Baby Ray\\'s Honey Barbecue Sauce\" was introduced  I had to give it a try.  And I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.

       " \"Like I said in another review, I'm a confirmed hot chocolate snob.  I'm addicted to Dunkin Donuts hot chocolate and own a Keurig just to brew hot chocolate.  That's how hardcore I am.<br /><br />And this hot chocolate is, hands down, the best, most reasonably priced at-home hot chocolate I've ever found.  The variety is amazing, and while some tastes are better than others, there's not a truly awful flavor in the batch.  When I make it, I make it on the Keurig setting for 7.5 ounces, which makes it slightly more watery than is suggested (they suggest 6oz of water), but the result is still fairly creamy, rich, delicious, richly colored, frothy on the top, and well-flavored.  One of these days I might try brewing at the 5.25oz setting and making up the difference with half-and-half, but I don't know that my mind or tastebuds are prepared for how amazing that would taste.  But even when done with just hot water, this is just delicious hot chocolate.<br /><br />My breakdown of the flavors is as follows (my box is apparently a little different, but I got it at a different place):<br /><br />Caramel ~  There is a very pronnounced caramel flavor.  Almost like somebody poured caramel right into the cup.  The smell is amazing and the taste is just delicious.  The caramel does tend to overwhelm the chocolate a bit, so if you're not a fan of caramel you may find this too sweet.<br /><br />Supreme ~  Not a flavor I was initially excited to try, but the taste is very good.  By far and away the most chocolate-tasting hot chocolate in the batch, it's simple and just your typical, very chocolaty hot chocolate.  I really can't tell a difference between this and the hot chocolate at Dunkin Donuts.<br /><br />Hazelnut ~  It tasted like hot chocolate and it wasn't bad, but I didn't get any real flavor difference out of this than, say, your typical hot chocolate.  It tasted like a weaker version of Supreme.  Still very excellent, but no pronnounced unique flavor to speak of.  Nice though for when you want a good hot chocolate that doesn't blast your brain with chocolate overload.<br /><br />Mint ~  I would knock over my own mother for a cup of this.  It tastes EXACTLY like a Thin Mint cookie in liquid form.  While some may find it ever-so-slightly too minty and in need of maybe a little watering down, I think it's amazing.  Quite probably the best hot chocolate flavor available anywhere, and I'm not a minty person at all.<br /><br />White Chocolate ~  My least favorite flavor.  It tasted fine, though slightly off.  I guess it resembed white chocolate very well which is why it tasted so different (because yes, we all know, white chocolate isn't really chocolate...), kind of like sweetened milk.  I don't know...  Not bad, but not great.  Just different and not my favorite flavor.<br /><br />Raspberry ~  I expected the most out of this flavor and it is certainly very good, though unlike the others which seemed to have a very pronnounced flavor of chocolate along with the other taste, this one really didn't.  It did have a sweeter, berry-like taste to it, but more like artificial berry, Kool-Aid berry, which was good, but not quite the berry experience I wanted.<br /><br />Aside from the odd tasting white hot chocolate, this is darn near the perfect collection of delicious tasting hot chocolate available that is both easy to find and not painful to your wallet.  I wish the Irish Cream flavor was in this set, because that one is amazing too.<br /><br />I have nothing but great things to say about the Land O Lakes line of hot chocolate and I hope it's around to stay.  The price cannot be beat and the quality certainly makes you think you bought a far more expensive brand of cocoa.  Lindt taste on a Swiss Miss budget so it's darn near impossible to go wrong.\",\n",

It has more of a kick than other rubs I\\'ve tried, which I like. It isn\\'t blazing hot or anything, but the paprika and the mustard add a nice tang. The flavor is balanced but bold. It isn\\'t a delicately-flavored spice mix, which, again, I think of as a good thing; BBQ should provide a little kick, and this rub does. You can control that zing by 1) how much rub you use (I add a lot), 2) how long you let the meat marinate with the rub (I go overnight with it) and 3) how many additional ingredients you add to the mix (I add a few).<br /><br />I call this a base rub because I think adding a few things to your spice mix is a good thing. Me, I usually add to this rub some additional brown sugar and some Italian spice mix before applying to the meat. If I want something a little different, I\\'ll add a bit of nutmeg or maybe some ground celery seed, which is something you\\'ll find in BBQ rubs and sauces at places like Kansas City\\'s Gates\\' Restaurants or the many Famous Dave\\'s scattered throughout the Midwest. With BBQ, personalization is always a good thing. But don\\'t feel you have to go crazy if you want to keep things simple; this rub is satisfying as is, straight out of the shaker.<br /><br />I bought the pack of 12 because 1) the price is excellent (most competing rubs with this kind of flavor usually sell for at least twice the price) and 2) you\\'ll likely use up the rub more quickly than you think. For every two racks of ribs I cook, for instance, I end up using at least two-thirds of a 5.5-ounce container. Since I cook ribs and pork shoulder pretty often, I run through this stuff fairly quickly, especially during the summer.<br /><br />If you like to use rub on steak or chicken, you\\'ll tear through your supply more quickly. If you don\\'t use it as frequently as I do, you won\\'t have much of a problem: Just store your rub someplace cool and dark and it\\'ll keep a long time.<br /><br />I\\'ve used a number of store-bought rubs over the years, including those from Arthur Bryant\\'s and the aforementioned Famous Dave\\'s (which are also very good, by the way). I can honestly say Sylvia\\'s is one of my favorites -- not just because of the taste, but because of the bang you get for your buck.<br /><br />By the way, here\\'s a little trivia. Years ago, before I moved to NYC, I read an interview with Sylvia in Molly O\\'Neill\\'s \"New York Cookbook\" where Sylvia said she doesn\\'t smoke her pork ribs but just slow cooks them in an oven, using rub to add the BBQ-ey flavor. Not using smoke gets a lot of \\'cue stalwarts riled up, but that\\'s just the way her family had always fixed ribs and that\\'s how she still fixes them today. And they\\'re excellent. So if you catch grief from some food snob for cooking your ribs indoors without smoke, don\\'t fret: Sylvia has your back.',\n",

The first one I received looked old in a good bonsai way.  The new one I received looks like a young tree (not 5 years at all) and has no interesting shape.  It just looks like a tree.  It is pretty and we decided to keep it because it was healthy.<br />Another con is that even though the pot is very cool looking, it has a water hole on the bottom so you need a tray or else water gets on your furniture.  By the photo I thought the water drained into the water pot... some of it does, the rest ends up on the furniture.

Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4\" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.

I still use kibble because it\\'s the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I\\'ve fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she\\'d have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that\\'s why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you\\'re not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn\\'t want this to turn into a \"raw food is the only way to go\" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it\\'s easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn\\'t gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they\\'re supposed to.  Canidae doesn\\'t help my dogs\\' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae\\'s taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn\\'t have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs\\' sensitive systems, it\\'s a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs\\' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I\\'ve fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I\\'ve stuck with Canidae\\'s grain free ALS.<br /><br />I\\'ve also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don\\'t care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon\\'s price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I\\'d like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it\\'s a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.',\n",

       " \"We just LOVE this popcorn. We got introduced to it when I bought my wife a true popcorn machine (Great Norther 4oz Chaplain Popper and Cart). The popper and popcorn have been a wonderful addition to our home for the last 4 years and I have no plans to change any time soon.<br /><br />The simplicity of the popcorn kit packaging is great. Premeasured popcorn, salt (with butter flavor), and oil (which is solid at normal ambient room temperature make this such an easy job of making popcorn any time we want it.<br /><br />Turn on the kettle and let it heat up for 3-5 min. Squeeze out the oil and add the salt. I will say that if you use all the salt, it's quite a salty batch. We have found that using about half of the salt is about perfect. Wait till the oil is heated through and then add the popcorn. Pull down the kettle lid and wait.<br /><br />Part of the fun for us is the magic of making our own popcorn. Our kids just can't not watch the machine do the work.<br /><br />Now if one wants to complain that not all the kernels pop, I would argue that it's likely a combination of both the popcorn and the dimensions of your popping kettle. Do we lose some kernels? Yes (about 10%). Do I care? No. And why don't I care...<br /><br />The TASTE and Quantity! Even with loss of some kernels, this 4 oz package will feed 2 adults and 2 kids (5 and 2) for an entire movie. Just the perfect amount for us too. As for the taste - I don't know how anyone can eat any other popcorn once they've tasted Great Northern. I simply refuse to eat the microwave popcorn that we might make because we just don't want to clean the popcorn machine after use. The secret to that amazing, delicious, and addictable popcorn taste? Coconut Oil. It seems like such a simple ingredient, but the popcorn flavor that it helps to generate is simply amazing.<br /><br />The price is extremely reasonable too. And when I found that you could sign up for Amazon's subscribe and save, I signed up immediately. What a way to keep our machine fully stocked with the most authentic flavored movie popcorn ready for our weekly family movie night.\",\n",

The clear pungent liquid is called \\'ngapi\\' in Burmese, \\'nam pla\\' in Thai, \\'nuoc nam\\' in Vietnamese \\'yu chiap\\' in Chinese, and \\'patis\\' in Tagalog. Tiparos is a good brand, and this is a proper price.<br /><br />The Thais serve \"prik nam pla\" as a condiment on the table for every meal. It\\'s simple \\'fish sauce\\' with chopped Thai chilis, those little hot devils, and chopped coriander weed, commonly called \\'cilantro\\' in parts of the USA. It\\'s indispensable. You can judge the authenticity of a Thai restaurant by whether you are served prik nam pla automatically, or have to ask for it, or can\\'t even get it. In the latter case, you are ethically authorized to walk out without paying your bill.<br /><br />Likewise, any Thai or Vietnamese cookbook that doesn\\'t discuss the uses of fish sauce would be better reserved for starting campfires.<br /><br />As I said, the Romans used the same stuff, which they called LIQUAMEN. My guess is that as the Empire was transformed by immigration from the north, especially via Gaul, fish sauce was replaced by sea salt and rock salt. The Haida, Tlingit, and Kwakiutl peoples of the Pacific Northwest used the oil squeezed from candlefish for a similar taste treat. That oil was so valuable as a trade item that wars were fought over it.<br /><br />Soya sauce is NOT an adequate substitute, whatever your Betty Crocker cookbook says. But now you can get fish sauce anywhere you choose to live. I\\'m still getting accustomed to the implications of internet shopping. Imagine this: I can get a novel by Roberto Bola&ntilde;os, a DVD opera by Monteverdi, and a bottle of Tiparos nam pla, all in one package delivered to my door by the US Postal Service.',\n",

My impression of this Newman's Dark Chocolate is it is priced as if it belonged to category #2, but tastes more like it belongs in category #1 (I suppose high end of category #1).

I found the ruby red grapefruit to be absolutely AMAZING. The dill pickles tasted so much like sweet pickles, I had to double check the jar to make sure they weren't! Pinot grigio was particularly delicious, as the tablet cut through the sour-ness turning it super sweet!!<br /><br />Oranges were okay, just tasted a little sweeter than normal. The lemons were still a bit sour but I found myself eating 4 slices of them, which I don't think I could have done without the tablets! I swear, the ruby red grapefruit was by far the best, in my opinion.<br /><br />We found that the more sour a food, the more drastic an effect. I definitely recommend trying these tablets with a full fridge so you can experience all types of foods! I'd say some grapefruit, lemons, and dill pickles are a must to try with these.<br /><br />They're great to try with friends, as the novelty wears off after one or two tries. As long as there are new people around though, it's fun to see other reactions to the tablets. Definitely recommend!!\",\n",
       " \"My Baby Brezza journey is so disheatening that I have to share. I did extensive research into baby food maker and as most of you who are reading this, I narrowed it down to the Brezza and the Beaba. Brezza won me over with the one button touch and step away function. So....<br /><br />November 2011: Bought Baby Brezza on cyber monday sale (was around 100 bucks), arrived 2 weeks later -- dead on arrival. Plugged it in, no light, no function, nothing. Thankfully, my baby wasn't quite eating yet. Called Baby Brezza/emailed, a few days later a new machine came out to me.<br />Jan - March 2012: Brezza #2 working well, around the end of March, started seeing a black oiling residue. I'm a pretty chill mom, so just wiped it off and soldiered on.<br />April 2012: Brezza #2 stopped working, steams fine, but will NOT blend, can hear the motor, but no action. Called Customer service, again a few days to connect up. The agent said there was an old batch of shafts that have caused problems, will send new shaft -- a few weeks later a new Brezza showed up.<br />May 2012: On to Brezza #3, plugged it, made applesauce, take extra care regarding the shaft (purported to be new and awesome). Brezza #3 stopped working 10 hours after arrival (2 batches of baby food). Called customer service, no answer, called again, left a VM, called again, spoke to a very apologetic lady who states she will send out another new shaft and as compensation for all the inconvenience an accessory of my choice. Per her, it should arrive within 4-5 days.<br />June 2012: still waiting, almost 14 days later, placed another call to customer service.<br /><br />So my advice.<br /><br />1. didn't save money (need to have jarred baby food on hand in case your Brezza busts)<br />2. went through 3 units in 5 months<br />3. Spent A LOT of time tracking down Baby Brezza customer service.<br />4. Have a lot of spare Brezza parts in my house.<br /><br />If you were thinking about buying, consider getting it at the big box store so when it busts you can just return it and get your money back and lessen the anger and frustration at this product.<br /><br />Cheers, hope it helps.

It\\'s not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that\\'s not saying much.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can\\'t understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it\\'s \"like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut\" or \"tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee\". No, and no!  It\\'s also a far cry from \"cafe mocha\", as well.  Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience.<br /><br />It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all.  If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst.<br /><br />I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer\\'s [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor.  I kept hoping it would get better, but such was not the case. It was all I could do to finish the cup of coffee and not throw it out.',\n",

       " \"*****The 2 star review is not necessarily for the coffee inside the k-cup - but for the way the Van Houtte k-cups I ordered malfunctioned.*****<br /><br />I received 2 boxes of Van Houtte Honduras k-cups from Amazon in mid October.  The first few were fine - the coffee was good - nothing spectacular, but not bad either.  Then I noticed my machine was dripping very slowly, then hardly at all. I also saw that coffee grounds were dripping through along with the coffee.  When I opened the top of my Keurig machine, I saw that the k-cup was overflowing with water and coffee grounds. My Keurig machine was only a few weeks old and had been working wonderfully until that time.  I cleaned it out and tried another Van Houtte k-cup hoping that would take care of it.  The same thing happened.  I cleaned the machine again and ran hot water through it a few times to make sure the grounds were all out of it and tried a different brand of k-cup.  It was fine. I used the other brands for a few days and didn't have any problems.<br /><br />Then I tried the Van Houtte again and the same thing happened.  I repeated the cleaning - ran hot water through it and tried another one. Ditto.<br /><br />I think I may have gotten a defective box or two.  The foil on top isn't flat - but is puffed up as if there's too much air inside. The coffee doesn't seem to be very loose when it's shaken like the other brands of k-cups I have. Perhaps they were filled too much.<br /><br />Since I had used so many of the Van Houtte trying to fix my machine,  I figured I was stuck with the remainder.  I still called Amazon to let them know there might be a problem with the product. Not only did they refund my purchase  - they did not ask me to return the remainder of my order. I doubt I will use them - I'm afraid they'll clog up my Keurig machine.<br /><br />Thanks again Amazon - your customer service is terrific, as always.\",\n",

Also changes the color of my shake to a rather unappetizing greenish brown, but that isn't relevant to the taste or quality of the product, but thought I'd mention it as some folks get bothered by stuff like that. Anyway, the heaviness of the powder requires shaking the shaker bottle half to death while I try to drink the darn thing, but I still gave it 4 stars for the fiber and other assorted healthy attributes of the powder, as well as the fact that it has no strong taste, all of which I very much like. I am going to use up all I bought (which is gonna take a loooong time at 1 tbsp a day to get through three pounds of powder!) but I am very unlikely to order again, simply for the gritty texture and heaviness that requires almost constant agitation in the shaker  bottle.

Since I only drank tea at restaurants and my Mom\\'s at obligatory dinners, no big deal.  Well as I slipped towards 50 I began to drink more coffee (which I liked) but which eventually led to a parting of ways due to the fact that the coffees I liked, did not return the favor and feeling slightly nauseous was not the desired effect I was looking to achieve.

I tried <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN2F\">Tazo Passion Tea, 24 Tea Bags</a> and while good it was missing that elusive element combination of good taste and adequate energy boost.

So without any additional ramblings are my opinions:  English Breakfast Tea = 5 Star, this stuff is great  /  Irish Breakfast Tea = Again 5 Stars, maybe a infinitesimal edge over the English version / Earl Grey = 4 Stars, good taste and flavor, not as good as the breakfast teas (IMHO) but probably better for later in the evening  / Lady Grey = WTF??  This stuff was horrible, I tried to use 1 bag of it with 2 bags of the others to keep from pitching it into the trash but to no avail, I am gonna give it to someone who has no taste buds.  1 Star.<br /><br />Again, realize I am far from a connoisseur of fine tea but I know what I like and what I don\\'t, I am going to buy a few boxes of the breakfast teas and enjoy them.  BTW I also bought a huge box of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE\">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a> and to prove my tastes are obviously out of the norm I hated it (I wanted to love it but alas it has something added to it that sure ain\\'t tea)',\n",

       " 'I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word \"Bold\" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn\\'t even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don\\'t like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don\\'t overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a \"Bold\" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion.

When I learned that jerky was a great snack for dieters who wanted protein on-the-go, while avoiding the added carbs in meal replacement bars, I searched for a brand of jerky that was right for me.<br /><br />Knowing very little about jerky (save for the junk in convenience stores), I learned that most brands are full of hormones, nitrites, antibiotics, MSG, and erythorbate. Supposedly, none of these ingredients are harmful in moderation, but I was looking for a snack that I could rely on whenever I had food cravings, and I couldn't afford to compromise my health in the long run by regularly consuming any of these items. So, I was pleased to find out about Golden Valley's line of all natural jerky.<br /><br />Aside from the benefit of finding a vendor that produced a jerky free of preservatives and added MSG, there was the added bonus of learning that federal law actually prohibits the use of growth hormone in buffalo. My mind at ease, I ordered the peppered buffalo jerky and received it in record time using the super saver shipping option.<br /><br />As a meat snack, I found the product to be too sweet for my liking, but nevertheless adequate for my purposes. The texture is milder than the low quality jerky that I'm familiar with, but the pepper flavor could easily go unnoticed as it's way too understated. Every bag that I received was moist and easy to chew and the product was free of flaw or defect.<br /><br />At $1.49/oz., I get 11 grams of protein for the cost of 90 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 7 grams of sugar. Compare this to the leading meal replacement bar on Amazon that costs $2.07/bar for 27 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of fat, 26 grams of sugar (51 grams of total carbs), and a litany of unwanted ingredients in each 3.5-oz. bar. Ounce-for-ounce, we're looking at 11 grams of protein in the jerky versus roughly 8 grams of protein in the bar. Even considering the disappointing sweetness of the jerky, I still manage to avoid all the unwanted carbs and confections of replacement bars. Of course, jerky loses out in terms of cholesterol content.<br /><br />Jerky connoisseurs will likely find the sweetness of this product to be unappealing and off-putting. On the other hand, it's been a great diet aid and a reliable, additive-free defense against mid-meal cravings, and that's really all I wanted out of Golden Valley's Buffalo Jerky.\",\n",

Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle.

It\\'s got little curly Q\\'s that sprout out of it while it\\'s cooking. But i thought i\\'d take that \"quality\" and deliberately market it towards my kids.  hehehe!  I told them some really creative people figured out how to make this really fun food for kids and how to get it to grow little curly Q\\'s when it cooked, and that it was pretty silly. I asked them what they thought and they laughed at the look of it. It takes very similar to rice, so i likened it to that for the kids, but told them it wasn\\'t rice so it does taste a little different. My oldest child is apprehensive about certain foods, and i didn\\'t know how\\'d she\\'d react to this.  My middle one is the type who would rather go hungry than try stuff he doesn\\'t think looks right. And my youngest will eat anything.  All 3 of them LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  I made it first by mixing fresh tomatoes, avocado, cilantro, lemon juice, onion, chicken, sour cream, cheese, cumin and chili powder.  The girls ate all of theirs and my youngest snagged my bowl and ate all of mine the moment i got up from the table for a min. And they\\'ve never like avocado or onion in stuff!  My son wouldn\\'t even try it, which didn\\'t surprise me. But i had him taste the few plain grains that stuck to the side of the pot, and he ate every single one of them (and his quesadilla).  Today i made it plain by boiling in water.  Then just squirted a little Bragg\\'s Liquid Aminos (or soy sauce) on it, and all 3 DEVOURED it!

I love that it\\'s packed with 6 grams of protein, and 6 grams of fiber, and 3 grams of good ol\\' fashioned healthy fats.  They love that it\\'s red and has curly Q\\'s.

Fiber helps lower cholesterol and reduces the impact of high glycemic index foods.  While some people choose to take supplements like psyllium, I prefer actually eating food...or the next closest thing.<br /><br />The crispbreads have a somewhat cardboard taste, but mainly tasted like toasted grains, with maybe a hint of cinnamon (but i'm probably imaginging that).  They are not sweet or salty or anything else appetizing.  However, they work great as a vehicle for just about anything. My wife and I enjoy making little peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with them for a filling snack.  If I just want to get some extra fiber, I'll eat a crisp or two with some cheese or honey.  So the flavor is not an issue at all if you put something yummy on top.  What is an issue is how incredibly dry these things are.  make sure you have something to drink with these; that should go withotu saying though, when you are eating something that's mostly fiber.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend these to anyone looking to get a little more fiber, which should include a ton of people.

Fiber really does have a noticeable benefit to your health and well-being, so definitely give these a try!\",\n",

It does exactly what it says it\\'ll do.  here\\'re some of my observations:<br />Pro\\'s-<br />1. this machine steams veggies and fruits very well, you can leave it unattended and it\\'ll shut off (although I still walk over and unplug it).  it takes about 15 minutes for sweet potatoes for example and about 10 (or less) for apples. They come out just the right consistency.<br />2. the machine is small and takes little counter space<br />3. it\\'s very easy to operate (a minor gripe I have is that it takes a while to \"click\" everything into place, easy once you get used to it)<br />4. I found it faster to make baby food with Babycook vs. cooking veggies in a pot and transferring into a blender/food processor.<br />5. the size of it is just right; for small babies, it makes at least 4-5 servings of food.  I don\\'t think it\\'s small at all.  I find myself using it about every other day, if that - i make one type of food on sat, freeze leftovers and make something else on tues and/or wed- this will take me through most of the week, if i keep taking out frozen portions. Between peeling veggies, chopping, steaming and blending, it takes me about 25 min to make one type of food, but it lasts for a while.<br />6. reheating /defrosting is easy and quick, beats the Microwave.  I would suggest to purchase Beaba food containers and use them to reheat your food, they fit perfectly into the Babycook - or any small glass dish would do.<br />7. I think i\\'ll keep using it as a blender/food processor after I no longer need steamed veggies pureed, it chopps up chicken and steak very well too.  So I\\'d estimate about a year\\'s worth of use out of it, maybe longer.  In babyworld, that\\'s a long time:)<br />Cons<br />8. cost - it\\'s not cheap, although I found a better price elsewhere (see wayfair.com)<br />9. you have to transfer food out of a steaming container to the main container to blend, that\\'s an extra step - as compared to Brezza, where you only use one container.<br /><br />PS - even though the main container is plastic, i found that carrots for example don\\'t stain the plastic, it\\'s held up well so far.',\n",

Because it has the right blend of ingredients for me, even if the flavor had been nonexistent, I would have been happy with it, so I\\'m extra-pleased that there is a nice mint flavor and that it does last for at least 15 minutes (I only want to chew it for that length of time, so I didn\\'t try it for longer).<br /><br />---<br />Note that this gum is manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it\\'s non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other up-and-coming brands of xylitol gum, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.<br /><br />---<br />Apparently if the mouth has 5 exposures to xylitol a day, its health improves greatly after only a few weeks.<br /><br />(My main concern is to reinforce the enamel of my teeth as much as possible, because they have been sensitive for years and the sensitivity is getting worse with age.)<br /><br />To that end, I\\'m going to order a 16-ounce package of xylitol crystals/powder soon (I found a cheaper offer on another site than I did here) and mix a little of the powder with water each day in a jar and swish the solution around my mouth a couple of times a day, so I can extend the lifespan of my stock of this expensive gum by chewing it just once or twice a day.<br /><br />If you want to avoid xylitol from China and/or from corn, also take care when purchasing the crystals/powder in either 16-ounce packages or small single-serving packages - I found very few brands that get their xylitol from birch.',\n",

The minute I got home, I measured out the ingredients and in 30 minutes (plus cooling time) I had perfect blondies almost exactly like my Grandmother\\'s.

Total disaster. They were wet and under-cooked. I was pretty disappointed. I checked the package to make sure I added the right amount of egg, oil and water. Check. I also had originally scooped out the first batch\\'s dry mix very loosely as the package indicated I should. But it was obvious that the ratio was off.<br />Back to the natural food store- bought two more packages! Today, I got out the digital food scale and weighed the mix. (Make sure you understand how to use the scale- you have to be sure that you are taking into account the weight of the container you are using.) I divided it exactly in half by weight, then measured them out again and was pretty confident I had an exact split. The batch just came out of the oven and is even more perfect than the original one. I am confident the next batch from the same bag will be perfect.<br /><br />***I added a scant 1/3 cup of very loose dark brown sugar to the mix both times (after weighing) because I knew it wouldn\\'t be sweet enough for my husband. I also added a little extra bit of salt. The first batch I made, I added a splash of good vanilla extract to, but I forgot it this time.

I will never buy this again and do not recommend it to others. I hope we just got a bad shipment, I can't imagine that so many people would drink this on purpose.\",\n",

Also, I have read some bad remarks on this product, so it doesn't sound like it is all that good, anyway.

       " 'I never liked energy drinks before tasting Monster Rehab.  When I finally got around to trying Rehab at the suggestion of friends, I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the green label \"regular\" Monster drink, Rehab is very light.  It does not have a syrup-like feeling going down and it only has 20 calories per can compared to about 200 in the regular drink.  The flavor is mostly lemonade with a hint of tea (much like the \"Half and Half\" teas on the market).  Unlike most drinks sweetened with sucralose there was no chemical aftertaste.  The energy rush from the drink took about 10-20 minutes to set in and lasted about 2.5 hours.  Although most of the people I know use Rehab as a coffee replacer in the mornings (lemonade with the effects of coffee is a great way to start the day), I drink this every weekend so I can stay up late with my family.<br /><br />As much as I like this drink, I wouldn\\'t buy it from Amazon at the price they are listing.  Once a month Rehab goes on sale in grocery stores and you can get a can for $1.50-$1.99 vs. $2.30 being charged by Amazon.  Wait for the sales then stock up.',\n",

So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy.\",\n",

Good sized olives with a consistently very firm, meaty texture, not a mushy one in the bunch.  Olives come in a tasty but very salty brine and wine vinegar mixture.  Right out of the keg you can't eat too many because of the salt, but the flavor is very good.  For regular eating we do the following.  We take a portion of the olives, drain and rinse them, and transfer them to another container and fill with cold water.  We let it sit for several hours and change out the water. We repeat this a couple more times with a final wash that is left overnight to 2-days with something added to season and spice them up.  Use dried red pepper, fresh jalapenos or whatever.  Then they are well drained and put in a separate container with more fresh sliced peppers and covered with olive oil.  Here they stay as they are consumed overthe next week or two.
